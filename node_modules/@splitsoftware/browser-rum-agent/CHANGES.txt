0.4.1 (February 2, 2024)
 - Updated some transitive dependencies for vulnerability fixes.
 - Bugfixing - Updated `tti` event collector to handle Type Errors when running the `tti-polyfill` script on some specific environments, like Vite/Webpack developer servers, where the polyfill is not supported.

0.4.0 (December 22, 2023)
 - Updated `SplitRumAgent.track` and `SplitRumAgent.trackError` methods to return a boolean value. This value indicates whether the event was successfully queued or not (i.e., it was dropped). An event is dropped if it has an invalid eventTypeId, value or properties, if the queue is full, or if user consent is declined.
 - Updated internal implementation to avoid throwing errors in non-browser environments (i.e. environments where `window` and `document` objects are not available), enhancing support for testing frameworks like Jest.

0.3.2 (October 19, 2023)
 - Added user consent feature to allow delaying or disabling the event tracking until user consent is explicitly granted or declined. Read more in our docs.
 - Updated `web-vitals` dependency to version 3.5.0 that includes multiple fixes and improvements.
 - Bugfixing - Fixed an issue with parsing error events, which caused the agent to not track errors occurring in scripts from different origins.

0.3.1 (September 27, 2023)
 - Updated internal implementation to push events on 'visibilitychange' and 'pagehide' DOM events, instead of 'unload', which is not reliable in modern mobile and desktop Web browsers.
 - Bugfixing - Fixed a runtime error when the agent is loaded asynchronously and errors were tracked in the `window.__error` object.

0.3.0 (August 14, 2023)
 - BREAKING CHANGES:
    - Renamed CDN URL from "https://cdn.split.io/rum-agent/rum-agent-X.Y.Z.min.js" to "https://cdn.split.io/rum-agent/browser-rum-agent-X.Y.Z.min.js".
    - Renamed global object from `SPLIT_RUM` to `SplitRumAgent`.
    - Removed `SPLIT_RUM.init` method. Use `SplitRumAgent.setup` instead.
    - Removed `SPLIT_RUM.error` method. Use `SplitRumAgent.trackError` instead.
    - Removed `SPLIT_RUM.identities` method. Use `SplitRumAgent.addIdentities` instead.
    - "time.to.interactive" event is not collected by default. To enable it, register the `tti` event collector (See documentation).
    - "time.to.first.byte" event is not collected by default. To enable it, register the `webVitals` event collector (See documentation).
 - Added:
    - NPM package `@splitsoftware/browser-rum-agent` to support CommonJS and ES modules.
    - Method to setup the agent: `SplitRumAgent.setup`, which replaces `SPLIT_RUM.init` and accepts the SDK Key and an optional configuration object.
    - Methods to configure identities: `SplitRumAgent.getIdentities`, `SplitRumAgent.addIdentity`, `SplitRumAgent.addIdentities`, `SplitRumAgent.removeIdentities`.
    - Methods to send custom events: `SplitRumAgent.track`, `SplitRumAgent.trackError`.
    - Methods to customize event properties: `SplitRumAgent.getProperties`, `SplitRumAgent.setProperties`, `SplitRumAgent.removeProperties`.
    - Pluggable event collectors: `webVitals`, `routeChanges`, `tti`; and a method to register them: `SplitRumAgent.register` (See documentation).
    - Type definitions for TypeScript projects.
 - Updated:
    - Queueing mechanism to validate events and flush them if queue is full.

0.2.1 (August 9, 2019)
 - Updated log messages and parameter validation of `SPLIT_RUM.init` and `SPLIT_RUM.identities` methods.

0.2.0 (July 3, 2019)
 - Added `SPLIT_RUM.identities` method to support multiple identities (user key & traffic type pairs).
 - BREAKING CHANGES:
    - Replaced `SPLIT_RUM.configure` method with `SPLIT_RUM.init` and `SPLIT_RUM.identities` methods.
    - Renamed `SPLIT_RUM._getConfig` method to `SPLIT_RUM.__getConfig`

0.1.0 (June 30, 2019)
